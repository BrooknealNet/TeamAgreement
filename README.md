# Team Agreement
Gerald Bruno, Jeffery Flores, Wasim Soomro, ChristianRhey Tojot 

## Cooperation Plan
### What are the key strengths of each person on the team?
Gerald Bruno - Inquisitive, Research, JavaScript
Jeffery Flores - CSS, planning, and communication  
Wasim Soomro - Research, writing, communication,    
ChristianRhey Tojot - Active Listening, Flexibility, Fast learner

### How can you best utilize these strengths in the execution of your project?

We’ve identified that some of us are better at CSS whereas others are better at JavaScript. We can identify a go-to member on our team to consult regarding those specific questions. We’ve also identified some soft skills that are going to help facilitate team cohesion and collaboration in completion of this project.

### In which professional competencies do you each want to develop greater strength?

Gerald Bruno - Collaboration, Root Cause Solution, CSS - Especially GRID
Jeffery Flores - coding within JS, and technical craft, technical lego   
Wasim Soomro - Hard coding skills including CSS and JavaScript, technical craft, 
ChristianRhey Tojot - Critical Thinking, Problem Solving, Accountability

### Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?

We will do a daily standup using GitHub projects every morning where we come together and identify our tasks for the morning session and then do another stand-up at the end of the morning session and resasses tasks for the afternoon session before breaking for lunch. 

## Conflict Plan

### What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?

We will incorporate the following steps escalating resolution procedures as needed: 
Communication is key. We will identify in a direct manner what the conflict is about and attempt to talk through it.
If we cannot talk through it, we will write down in our Slack group the issues surrounding the conflict. After each of the team members have written our grievances, that might offer a cooling off period to reassess the situation and offer a new perspective. 
Take a 10 minute break from working and try to address the conflict again.
Consult with Audrey

### What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?
Kindly remind the person who is taking over the project that although we appreciate their expertise and knowledge and will come to count on it, part of the purpose of this assignment is to offer the other group members the opportunity to learn and by taking over the project they’re depriving their peers the opportunity to learn.

### How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?

As mentioned above, we will remind each other that we’re all at different paths in our learning journey but it is commendable that we’ve all taken the time to pursue this learning. We’re starting at different points and will end at different points. We know where we’re at in our lives and will remind ourselves the only person we have to be better than is ourselves. 

The Man In The Glass – Poem by Peter Dale Wimbrow Sr.
When you get what you want in your struggle for self
And the world makes you king for a day
Just go to the mirror and look at yourself
And see what that man has to say.
For it isn’t your father, or mother, or wife
Whose judgment upon you must pass
The fellow whose verdict counts most in your life
Is the one staring back from the glass.
He’s the fellow to please – never mind all the rest
For he’s with you, clear to the end
And you’ve passed your most difficult, dangerous test
If the man in the glass is your friend.
You may fool the whole world down the pathway of years
And get pats on the back as you pass
But your final reward will be heartache and tears
If you’ve cheated the man in the glass.
Peter Dale Wimbrow Sr.
### How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?

In a kind and direct manner. We will make sure to address it the same day as the duration of this project is only a week. We will kindly ask them first if there were any exigent circumstances in their life that day. If that’s the case we will understand why the member could not contribute. If the individual has an emergency or situation everyday we will bring in Audrey to assist. If there was no emergency we will kindly let them know we expected more of a contribution from them that day and hope they bring their best selves tomorrow. 

### How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?

If on the second day the resolution attempts are not successful we will let the team member know that we are on day 2 of this project and still do not believe the member had contributed appropriately. We will ask them to put their best foot forward on day 3 and by the lunch break on day 3 if the team member has not shown up to work, we will remind them that we agreed as a team to inform our lead instructor that one of the team members has failed to contribute 2.5 days into the project. 

## Communication Plan

### What hours will you be available to communicate?
0900 PST - 1200 PST - Morning Coding Session
1200 PST - 1300 PST - Lunch
1300 - Until The Team Needs - Evening Coding Session
### What platforms will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?
Slack and REMO
### How often will you take breaks?
As needed for the individual, but we’ll post in Slack we’re taking a break
### What is your plan if you start to fall behind?
We’re incorporating an end of morning session stand-up as well where we can reconvene and assess what tasks were and were not completed 
If one team member is done with their tasks we expect they would post in Slack they’re done with their tasks and available to help another team member
If the team does not have the bandwidth to support we will request TA help and instructor help
We will also consider adjusting the scope of our project to still meet class requirements but perhaps implement a less robust or sophisticated solution
### How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?
Slack
### What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard?
If someone is talking over others, gently remind them
Not interrupt each other
Google docs collaboration
### How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?
Keep an open mind and always helping each other out 
Remind each other that these relationships we build in class are equally if not more valuable than dominating a coding solution 
## Work Plan

### How will you all identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general?
In our morning standup at 0900 PST, we will go through our domain model for our project to identify tasks. We will assign them based on strengths and personal desire. We will use a project management tool to identify when those tasks are complete.
### What project management tool will be used?
We will use Git Projects.

## Git Process

### What components of your project will live on GitHub?
Our entire repository will live on GitHub.
### How will you share the repository with your teammates?
We’ve created an organization on GitHub where we are all collaborators and owners to the project.
### What is your Git flow?
We will create a staging branch on GitHub in addition to the main branch. We will create a separate branch on GitHub for specific tasks identified in Git Projects.
### Will you be using a PR review workflow? If so, consider:
Yes we will use a PR workflow. For merging into staging we will have one other person look at the merge. Before merging onto main we will have the entire team approve the merge. During our midday stand up we will merge work done in the morning. By 1700 PST we will ensure a second merge for the afternoon session has been completed. We will use Slack to identify exact merge times but using our method above, we will have structured timings for merges. Any of the team members can merge pull requests as long as it is not the person who pushed the code up.
